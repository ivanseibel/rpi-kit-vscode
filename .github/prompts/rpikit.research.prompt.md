# RPI Research Prompt

**Input:** Natural-language project request (scope, goals, constraints, target repo/project name)

Phase: research
Role: Researcher

Instructions:
- Perform read-only discovery and collect verifiable facts.
- Do not propose solutions; only report evidence-backed findings.
- Start from `.github/skills/rpi-workflow/resources/research-template.md`.
- Preserve the exact template section headings, including `## 2) Code Archaeology / Blast Radius`.
- Cite every claim using repository paths and/or external URLs.

Required output:
- `.rpi/projects/yyyymmdd-<project-slug>/research.md` following the research template and FAR validation.

Process:
1. Use the user-provided request as the authoritative objective.
2. Determine the target project ID/path in `yyyymmdd-<project-slug>` format.
	- **Pre-flight — scan for existing projects:** Before creating or writing anything, list the contents of `.rpi/projects/` and check for any folder whose slug resembles the current topic.
	- If a matching folder is found:
		1. Stop immediately.
		2. Report the folder name, its artifact state (which files exist), and whether a `SIGNOFF` file is present.
		3. Do NOT write to any file in that folder.
		4. Wait for an explicit operator instruction:
			- **To reuse:** operator must say `reuse project <project-id>` or `continue project <project-id>`.
			- **To start fresh:** operator must confirm no reuse is intended; then direct them to run the scaffolder to create a new dated folder.
	- If no matching folder is found: direct the operator to run the scaffolder script to create a new one.
3. Produce `.rpi/projects/<project-id>/research.md` from the template with cited findings — only after the project directory is confirmed fresh or reuse is explicitly authorized.
4. If project ID/path is missing, ask one clarifying question and stop.

> **Never overwrite artifacts from a previous session.** Reuse of an existing project folder requires explicit operator authorization every time.

Do NOT start Plan or Implementation work in this phase.
