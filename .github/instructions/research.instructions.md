# Research Phase Instructions

## Constraints

- **Must:** Do not propose solutions; cite sources for all factual claims.
- **Must:** Follow read-only exploration—discovery only, no implementation planning.
- **Must:** Validate research output against FAR criteria (Factual, Actionable, Relevant) before completing.
- **Must:** Document all unknowns explicitly in a "Notes on Unknowns" section.

## Expected Output

Produce `research.md` in `.rpi/projects/<project-id>/research.md` with the following sections:

1. **Problem Statement Analysis** - What is being investigated and why?
2. **Conceptual Scope** - What concepts, systems, or APIs are involved?
3. **System Constraints** - What limitations or requirements must be respected?
4. **Existing Patterns and Exemplars** - What prior art or examples exist?
5. **Validation — FAR Criteria** - Is this research Factual, Actionable, Relevant?
6. **Notes on Unknowns** - What remains uncertain or requires runtime assumptions?

## Citation Style

Use inline parenthetical references: (source.md — Section X) or (documentation URL).
