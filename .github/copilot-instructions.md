# RPI Constitution

This document is the RPI constitution for the repository.

This repository follows the Research → Plan → Implement (RPI) pattern for systematic software development.

## Core Principles

- **Research:** Read-only exploration phase. Must cite all sources. No solutions proposed, only facts gathered.
- **Plan:** Produce atomic task checklists with explicit verification steps. Each task must be independently testable.
- **Implement:** Follow `plan.md` strictly. No improvisation. If blocked, recurse to Plan or Research phase.

## Scoped Guidance

For phase-specific rules and constraints, see `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` files that apply to specific workspace paths.
